 My name is Janani Asokumar and I'm a first-year student studying Computer Science at UC Davis. Some of my revelant courseworks include ECS 36A and ECS 36B (concurrent) where I learned and am learning software development and object oriented programming. I'm actively looking for opportunties to implement my programming knowledge in the real-world and enrich my programming journey outside class.
